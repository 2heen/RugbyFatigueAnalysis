As part of Purdue's DataFest, my team and I analyzed data from the Canadian's Women's Rugby Team. Our goal was to determine fatigue levels.
We were provided with a variety of data, such as the number of games and the dates each player played, survey questions asked to the players
such as how sore they are, how many hours slept, any pain/illness, menstruation, nutrition, etc. By using this data, we evaluated each answer
from the players and determined whether they were fatigued or not.

NOTE: The data mentioned above was too big to upload to github.
